# erosion
experimenting with erosion algorithms
This project simulations hydraulic erosion with thousands of raindrops. Each drop absorbs or deposits a variable amount of
sediment based on its speed and the slope of the terrain.  

The simulation makes use of python's <code>multiprocessing</code> library
to leverage the extra processing power of multicore machines.  

The simulation is rendered in a live, interactive window using the Mayavi package for python.
